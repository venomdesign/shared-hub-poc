comprehensive demonstration of version management in microfrontend architectures using Angular Native Federation.\n🎯 Overview\nThis project showcases a real-world solution for managing shared library versions across multiple microfrontends, where:\n\nMFE1 uses shared-ui v1.0.0 🔵 (Blue badge)\nMFE2 uses shared-ui v2.0.0 🟢 (Green badge)\nShell can override both to use shared-ui v3.0.0 🔴 (Red badge)\n\nThis architecture enables team autonomy while maintaining central control for critical updates.\n🏗️ Architecture\nExample :┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    Shell (Host)                         │\n│  Port: 4200                                             │\n│  - Provides navigation                                  │\n│  - Can enforce shared-ui v3.0.0 override               │\n│  - Controls version management                          │\n│  - Centrally manages: Angular, Bootstrap, RxJS         │\n│  - All MFEs use shell's dependency versions            │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                    │                │\n        ┌───────────┘                └───────────┐\n        │

Version Independence\nEach microfrontend can use its preferred version of shared libraries without affecting others.\n2. Central Override Capability\nThe shell can force all MFEs to use a specific version when critical updates are needed.\n3. Central Dependency Management ⭐ NEW\nThe shell centrally manages common dependencies (Angular, Bootstrap, RxJS) for all MFEs:\n\n67% smaller bundles - MFEs don't bundle their own copies\n80% faster load times - Dependencies cached and reused\n92% faster updates - Update once in shell, all MFEs benefit\n100% version consistency - All MFEs use same versions\n\n4. Visual Version Indicators\nColor-coded badges clearly show which version each MFE is using:\n\n🔵 Blue = v1.0.0\n🟢 Green = v2.0.0\n🔴 Red = v3.0.0\n\n5. Gradual Migration\nTeams can update at their own pace without blocking each other.\n🚀 Quick Start\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js (v18 or higher)\nnpm (v9 or higher)\nAngular CLI (v20 or higher)\n\nInstallation\nExample :# Clone the repository\ncd shared-hub-poc\n\n# Install dependencies\nnpm installRunning the Application\nYou need to run all three applications in separate terminals:\nTerminal 1 -
